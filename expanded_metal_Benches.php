<p style="text-indent: 1em">  We offer a line of expanded metal benches manufactured with the same high quality materials as our signature Ebb & 
    Flow benches. Our benches with expanded metal tops are identical to our Ebb & Flow benches, except that they have expanded 
    metal bench tops in place of Ebb & Flow trays.<br> </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 1em">
    Many customers like to have some of their benches with expanded metal tops, typically in parts of their retail areas.
    Our expanded metal benches have the same legs and framework, as well as the same extruded aluminum side rails and rounded 
    corners as our Ebb & Flow benches. This allows for a completely cohesive appearance in areas with both types of benches. <br> </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 1em">
    The aluminum side rails extend approximately three inches above the expanded metal bench tops. This helps keep plants from being 
    knocked off the benches by employees or customers. The aluminum side rails and the expanded metal tops that are Hot Dip Galvanized 
    after being formed, resulting in a durable bench that will retain its clean, like new appearance for many years. </p>
