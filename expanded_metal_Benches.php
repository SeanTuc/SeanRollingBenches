    <p style="text-indent: 1em"> 
        We offer a complete line of expanded metal benches manufactured with the same quality materials as our signature MAX ROLL Ebb & Flow benches.
        Our benches with expanded metal tops are identical to our Max Rolls, except that they have expanded metal bench tops in place of
        Ebb & Flow trays. <br> 
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 1em">
        Many customers like to have some benches with expanded metal tops, typically in parts of their retail areas. Our expanded metal benches have the same 
        legs and framework, as well as the same extruded aluminum side rails and rounded corners, as our Ebb & Flow benches. This allows for a completely 
        cohesive appearance in areas with both types of benches. <br>
     </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 1em">
    The aluminum side rails extend approximately three inches above the expanded metal bench tops. This helps keep plants from being knocked off the benches
     by employees or customers. The expanded metal tops are hot dip galvanized after being formed which results in a durable bench that
      will retain its clean, like new appearance for many years.
