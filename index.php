          Our Ebb & Flow benches are designed and manufactured with only the quality materials available. 
          All benches have legs, leveling headers, and benchtop framework made from galvanized steel tubing from Allied Tubing. 
          Side and end rails are extruded using marine grade aluminum, and our rounded bench corners are also custom extruded aluminum.  
          The bench tops are vacuum formed UV resistant polystyrene, manufactured in long (1.5 and 2 meter lengths) to minimize 
          the need for glue joints, while still allowing for easy shipment. Our rolling benches provide almost effortless
