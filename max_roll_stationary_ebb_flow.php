    <b> Our Max Roll Ebb & Flow Benches are designed and manufactured with the grower in mind. All bench legs,
     leveling headers, and benchtop framework are made from galvanized steel tubing, easy to clean and maintain.
      Side and end rails are marine grade aluminum, and all bench corners are rounded. The bench tops are vacuum formed UV 
      resistant polystyrene. Our rolling benches provide almost effortless rolling ability to allow the bench-tops to roll left and right,
       maximizing your growing space and your ROI. <br> <br>
