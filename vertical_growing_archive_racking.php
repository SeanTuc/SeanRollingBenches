    <b> Maximize growing space without sacrificing aisle space!</b> <br> 
    Archive racking maximizes growing space without sacrificing aisle space. Optimize all available space in the grow area by having only one mobile aisle per room.
    You’ll have the ability to have your mobile aisle be as wide as you need, or as local laws allow or require.
